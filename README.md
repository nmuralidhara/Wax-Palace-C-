# Wax-Palace-C-

Description:
This is the code for the Wax Palace Game. This is mainly written in C. Since, the 2D-model in Java is not currently not working, I haven't uploaded it.

Aim:The avatar is in the wax palace with 11 rooms. He/she has to save his/her friend who is stabbed by the psycho killer and is in the verge of dying and kill the psycho-killer for his salvation who is roaming around the wax palace. The killer is blind and will be roaming around(or teleport) randomly. If he finds you, he will kill you. There are two types of floors, thick wax(represented by ',') and thin wax(represented by'.').If the player steps onto the thick wax, sound will be emitted and the killer would detect it and kill you. The killer won't kill the friend because he would be lying down pretending to be dead. 

Procedure:
You will start from the visitor's room locking his friend in the store room. You will take a candle(which would be helpful for melting thick wax floor to thin wax floor till a certain radius. First go to the Doctor's room and finda flute which when played will open his store room. Now you will take the special knife(which will you will use to kill the psycho-killer) which is activated yet and can only be activated by using the item in the sacred room. Also take the medikit. 

Go back to the visitor's room and use your key to open the door to your friend. Use the medikit there to giver him some extra life.



Now you will go to the sacred room and take a book which has hints: "Caps don't lock they open. Chain is the saviour. Candle doesn't burn it melts." You will take a cap and use it to unlock the Sacred Store Room. Also, you will activate your special knife here.

Passcode Explanation: The book says "Caps" don't "lock" they "open". The cap contains the text:"RUNGnum PASber". So, you will have to enter the CAPSLOCK letters "RUNGPAS" to unlock the door. 

Now you will get the dollar chain and wear it so that the psycho-killer doesn't kill you. (Book says "Chain is the saviour"). 

Head over to the psychokiller's room and get the candle. Use and place the candle to summon the killer. Since you are wearing the dollar chain and have an activated knife, you will be able to kill the killer right there thereby winning the game.

Extras:
If you want to explore the house, there is a map in the psychokiller's storeroom. Use it to find out other cool places in the mansion. Do not forget to go the attic for free food and the basement is a nice place to roam around.

To open the psychokiller's room, we have to type a password for the door. It is basically the number value of PASBER. P=16, A=1 etc. The code is 161192518.

Implementation details:
Pointer and arrays of length 1 were used to keep track of the status of the objects.
